## Installation

### Composer

The latest version can be installed via composer. This is especially useful if you want to create new  installation automatically or play with the latest code. You need to install the [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) package first if it isn't already available:
```
php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php -- --filename=composer
```
## Setup

Coming soon...
